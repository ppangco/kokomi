          <h2>Misconceptions</h2>

          <h3>• She deals no damage</h3>
          <p>Her damage during burst is actually comparable to Childe’s, having an average of 5-7k auto attacks with raw damage. With buffs (no food, only teammates), it can easily pass 10k and potentially reach 20k. A vape DPS Kokomi can potentially deal 70k with charged attacks, though this build is not recommended. The best and easiest build is 4p clam, and besides the hydro damage, she can deal 20k+ clam damage during burst (with hydro dmg cup) and 10-12k damage with skill outside burst (hp cup deals more damage and is more valuable as a support). What puts them apart in terms of damage is Childe’s notorious nuke burts. All those values take into consideration a C0 Kokomi with high level talents.</p>
          <h3>• She only has high usage on abyss for having low ownership (and the only people who pulled for her love her)</h3>
          <p>While it’s true that the abyss data that many people used as reference for a good team or character is misleading (a problem that has been recently addressed in the community), the discussion also brought wrong conclusions. Some people have been using this as a way to “debunk” Kokomi being useful in the abyss, so if we follow that logic, characters such as Yoimiya (who was also bashed pre and post release and has low ownership) should have high usage in the abyss, but that’s not what happened. There are a handful of 5* characters that have low ownership, but equally low usage; the best comparison to Kokomi would likely be Kazuha: both of them were bashed pre release and titled a “5* version of x 4* character”, and later become popular in the abyss. Now, I don’t mean that Kokomi is as valuable as Kazuha, he is still a lot more universal, but her utility is not neglectable. Also, support characters tend to have better longevity than DPS characters.</p>
          <h3>• She’s easily replaceable</h3>
          <p>I made a few comparisons in the next section specifically to show how Kokomi is not just a replacement, but rather has her own value that sets her apart from other unities. None of those comparisons are meant to show why she is better or why you should pull for her, they are meant solely to analyze her utilities and optimal roles. The characters listed can still be used instead of Kokomi in some comps if you so prefer, even if she were technically more effective.<p>

            similarities: 'Both can, to some extent, fulfill the same roles (with varying effectiveness): can hold TToDS and make full use of it (even though most people must have it at lv1), can use 4p clam, can work on and off-field, are safe on field drivers, have ER issues.',
            pros: 'FREE, can revive with C6 (something that, contrary to popular belief, many people do not have), buffs hydro dmg bonus for the active character at C2 (not that adding her to the team for this sole purpose is ever recommended), heals instantly with burst, skill is not stationary, strong vape DPS.',
            kokomi: 'Can heal and do damage with the same build, deals more damage as a hydro driver in a taser comp than Barbara, skill heals more and doesn’t freeze you (aside from casting), skill has big hydro application aoe (better for off field freeze support), high resistance to interruption during burst, capable of 100% skill uptime, can use 4p ToM.',
            conclusion: 'Both heal just fine. Barbara can be better in specific circumstances for being able to heal instantly without taking field time, as well as not needing low hp characters to stay on field (though it’s worth mentioning that Kokomi doesn’t need burst to heal, as long as you can keep other characters on field). Barbara can also work as a buffer, but Kokomi offers more options and has many more utilities. Barbara is rarely recommended in a comp if you have any other option, while Kokomi is a solid pick for many teams.'

            pros: 'Despite having comparable damage, Childe has nuke burst damage on top of that, and has more hydro application.',
            kokomi: 'Has more consistent damage, her C1 applies hydro faster than Childe, can heal and tank (safer on field).',
            conclusion: 'In terms of damage, Childe is a better pick in the typical reverse vape team, but they generally have different team comps—Kokomi is mostly used in taser and freeze, opening different possibilities by fulfilling the role of a healer herself.'

            pros: 'Burst has bigger damage (although her nuke potential only shows on vape, becoming quite underwhelming in her main role in freeze teams), her kit offers buff for other characters, skill is a taunt.',
            kokomi: 'Reliable healer, can make full use of Prototype Amber, TToDS and 4p ToM, applies hydro faster, can tank, can make continuous off field damage with clam + skill (not burst reliant as support).',
            conclusion: 'Both have solid spots in freeze teams. While you can use Mona as a healer, it’s not as safe as using Kokomi. By using Kokomi, you may miss a bit on buffs, but it opens a spot for another cryo DPS. Outside of freeze teams, Kokomi generally has more utility than Mona. Alternatively, you can use them together in a mono hydro team.'

            pros: 'Better off field enabler, is mobile and ranged, can battery himself and other hydros, C2 has hydro resistance shred, nuke skill (with vaporize), useful utility passive.',
            kokomi: 'Can work as on and off field enabler (although not as effectively off field), hydro application off field isn’t restricted to auto attacks, can hold TToDS, actual healer, tank, easier name to pronounce.',
            conclusion: 'They can have interchangeable roles for lack of better options when one is not available, but overall they have very different utilities. Kokomi is usually a better pick in freeze teams. For vape and taser, while serving the same utility, their roles are different: Kokomi is preferable on field and Xingqiu off field. Which of them to use depends on what characters you’re pairing them with. Alternatively, you can pair them and Xingqiu will serve as battery and buffer for Kokomi, or both can work together as enablers.'
          },
          {

            kokomi: 'Good on field driver, easy to build for damage, free sub dps with clam, good at reaction comps.',
            conclusion: 'Although having a similar feel, they have very different utilities. Zhongli is better in mono teams and paired with DPS characters that don’t synergize with healers or are easily interrupted. Kokomi, on the other hand, is a much better pick for most reaction teams. Basically, they don’t have interchangeable spots in the majority of their teams.'

            pros: 'You probably have several constellations, half of a cryo resonance, can run favonius weapon, skill is not stationary.',
            kokomi: 'Contributes more as on field driver, better pick in freeze teams (has good elemental application off field and doesn’t require burst as a support, while Qiqi, who also has burst issues, is outperformed by Diona, who is a battery), can hold TToDS and 4p ToM effectively.',
            conclusion: 'Kokomi is a lot more flexible than Qiqi, mostly for being a hydro catalyst, but they are essentially very similar when running 4p clam off field.'

Another interesting factor is that none of these characters can be replaced, but at least 3 of them are 4*.\nIn this Kokomi uses clam set, while Xiangling is also built for max damage (a good pick would be Kitain at r5—this weapon does not benefit from ER and only manages to get Xiangling’s burst back in time with high refinement).'
